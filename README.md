Insert Group Tool for Maya 2026
Overview
The Insert Group Tool is a Python script for Autodesk Maya 2026 that allows users to insert groups between selected objects and their parents in the scene hierarchy. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage selected objects, customize group names, and control pivot alignment, streamlining the process of organizing Maya scenes.
Features

Dynamic Object Selection: Add, remove, or clear objects from the selection list within the UI.
Flexible Group Naming: Choose naming conventions based on custom names, parent groups, or child objects, with prefix or suffix styles.
Pivot Control: Option to align group pivots with the selected object or reset to world origin (0, 0, 0).
Undo Support: All operations are undoable in Maya.
Error Handling: Validates inputs and provides feedback for missing objects or invalid inputs.
User-Friendly UI: Intuitive interface with collapsible sections for managing objects and group settings.

Requirements

Autodesk Maya: Version 2026
Python: Compatible with Maya's built-in Python interpreter (Python 3.x as included with Maya 2026)
Modules: Uses maya.cmds and maya.mel (included with Maya)

Installation

Download the Script:
Clone this repository or download the insert_grp.py file.


Place the Script:
Copy insert_grp.py to your Maya scripts directory:
Windows: ~/Documents/maya/2026/scripts/
macOS: ~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/2026/scripts/
Linux: ~/maya/2026/scripts/




Load the Script in Maya:
Open Maya 2026.
In the Script Editor, run the following Python command:import insert_grp
insert_grp.main()


Alternatively, create a shelf button for easy access:
In the Script Editor, execute the above commands.
Drag the command to the Maya shelf to create a button.





Usage

Launch the Tool:
Run the script as described above to open the Insert Group Tool UI.


Select Objects:
Select transform objects in your Maya scene.
Click Add Selected to add them to the tool’s list.
Use Remove Selected or Clear All to manage the list.


Configure Groups:
Add group fields to specify names for the groups to insert.
Check Object Pivot to align the group’s pivot to the selected object, or uncheck to use world origin.


Set Naming Options:
Choose a naming basis (Custom Name, Upper Group, or Lower Group).
Select a naming style (Prefix or Suffix).


Insert Groups:
Click Insert Groups to create the groups and reorganize the hierarchy.
The tool will insert groups between the selected objects and their parents, maintaining child relationships.


Review:
A confirmation message appears in the viewport upon success.
Use Maya’s undo (Ctrl+Z) to revert changes if needed.



Example Workflow

Select a cube (pCube1) parented to a group (group1).
Add pCube1 to the tool’s list.
Add a group field with the name MidGroup and enable Object Pivot.
Choose Custom Name and Prefix for naming.
Click Insert Groups.
Result: group1 → MidGroup → pCube1_GRP (renamed pCube1).



Notes

The tool only processes transform nodes.
Objects that no longer exist in the scene are automatically skipped with a warning.
Ensure unique group names to avoid naming conflicts in Maya.
The UI is designed to be intuitive, with collapsible sections for better organization.

Troubleshooting

UI doesn’t appear: Ensure the script is in the correct scripts directory and Maya 2026 is being used.
Errors during group insertion: Check the Maya Script Editor for detailed error messages. Common issues include invalid object selections or naming conflicts.
Objects not found: Verify that selected objects still exist in the scene before running the tool.
